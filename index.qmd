I work as a data analyst at [Inclusiv](https://inclusiv.org). When I can, I:

* compost at [Abyssinian Tot Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/Hpu3NwBHmcsRtrR69)
* take care of some [street trees near me](https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship) and
* maintain trails in [Highbridge Park](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/highbridge-park)

My lifelong project is to cook every recipe in Marie Simmons' [The Good Egg](https://bookshop.org/p/books/good-egg-more-than-200-fresh-approaches-from-breakfast-to-dessert-marie-simmons/11859628?ean=9780618711949)
